/* build-pages.mjs — refreshes the generated regions inside each page.
 *
 * Four regions, all derived from what the page already says, so none can disagree
 * with it:
 *   - element-level ids + data-kb-polarity on trade-off / usage / variation items,
 *     which give every claim a stable citation target (…#tradeoffs-con-2) and let a
 *     reader pull one item instead of a whole page.
 *   - section-level data-kb-level, stamped from the BLOCK_LEVELS policy in
 *     lib/model.mjs (and removed where the policy no longer applies). Authored
 *     data-kb-level lives on finer elements only and is never touched here.
 *   - a JSON-LD block in <head>, projected from the data-kb-* attributes. It is never
 *     hand-written; that is what keeps it honest.
 *   - the <head> asset pair — one stylesheet link, one loader script — from PAGE_ASSETS
 *     in lib/model.mjs. Authored tags drifted into nine different shapes across the
 *     corpus and 53 pages had silently lost favourites.js; deriving the pair means a new
 *     kind is one line of taxonomy rather than a sweep, and the staleness gate below
 *     catches the next drift.
 *
 * Everything else on the page is authored. Run: node scripts/build-pages.mjs [--check]
