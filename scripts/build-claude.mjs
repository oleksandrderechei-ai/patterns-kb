/* build-claude.mjs — emits the per-folder CLAUDE.md files.
 *
 * Claude Code loads a folder's CLAUDE.md when work touches that folder, so each one
 * is a short, local briefing: what this band is, what lives here, and the one rule
 * that folder enforces. They are generated because their content — the band label,
 * the pattern list, the band/group a page must declare — is derived. A hand-written
 * list of 14 messaging patterns would be stale the first time one was added.
 *
 * The root CLAUDE.md and README.md are hand-written, but their headline counts are corpus
 * facts that would rot; this also rewrites the inline <!-- kb:counts --> and
 * <!-- kb:page-count --> marker regions in both, and nothing else in them.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/build-claude.mjs   (add --check to fail if any is stale)

**${heading}** — ${list.length} pattern${list.length === 1 ? "" : "s"}.
${b.desc ?? `A lens: it reshapes how you build at any elevation, rather than being a rung on the ladder.`}

Pages here: ${list.map((n) => n.id).sort().join(", ")}

Every page in this folder declares \`data-kb-band="${list[0].band}"\` and
\`data-kb-group="${group}"\`. The path is checked against them — \`make check\` fails if a
page is filed anywhere else, so moving a page means changing its band or group, not just
its location.

Read a page with \`node ${up(dir)}scripts/kb.mjs get <id>\` — never open the .html to read it
(that costs ~3.6k tokens of markup for ~1.2k of prose).

Reading levels: every block shows at every lens; depth varies INSIDE blocks. The
mandatory \`explain\` ladder is a variant group — each lens renders only its own rung.
Two authored element attributes: \`data-kb-level\` (accretion — visible from this level
up, via \`kb.mjs level\`) and \`data-kb-register\` (variant — rendered at exactly that
lens, via \`kb.mjs register\`); one element carries at most one of them.

See the root CLAUDE.md for the data contract before editing anything here.

function forHazards(list) {
  return `# site/hazards

**Anti-patterns** — ${list.length} of them. Not to practise, only to recognise on sight.
Every one is what the patterns elsewhere exist to prevent.

Pages here: ${list.map((n) => n.id).sort().join(", ")}

Blocks, in order: ${BLOCKS.hazard.map((b) => `\`${b}\``).join(" → ")}.
Hazards carry no \`data-kb-solves\` — a hazard solves nothing, it *is* the problem — and no
"In the wild" block. They relate to patterns through \`mitigated-by\`, whose inverse
\`prevents-hazard\` must be declared on the pattern's page too.

Read with \`node ../../scripts/kb.mjs get <id>\`. See the root CLAUDE.md for the contract.
`;
}

function forThemes(list) {
  return `# site/themes

**Themes** — ${list.length} guided tours. Not a rung and not a lens: each one answers a single
systems question by walking through the patterns that combine to address it.

Pages here: ${list.map((n) => n.id).sort().join(", ")}

Blocks, in order: ${BLOCKS.theme.map((b) => `\`${b}\``).join(" → ")}.

A theme's \`tour\` block is the **source of truth for theme membership**. Each
\`.tour-step\` carries \`data-kb-member\` (which pattern) and \`data-kb-role\` (its terse role in
*this* narrative — distinct from the step's own prose). The build inverts those onto each
pattern as its "Where it shows up" list, so adding a pattern to a tour is what puts the
theme on the pattern's page. Themes carry no \`data-kb-solves\`.

Read with \`node ../../scripts/kb.mjs get <id>\`. See the root CLAUDE.md for the contract.
`;
}

function forDesigns(list) {
  return `# site/designs

**Case studies** — ${list.length} worked designs (the \`design\` kind). Each breaks one real
system down the way a strong interview answer would, and \`demonstrates\` the patterns it uses.

Pages here: ${list.map((n) => n.id).sort().join(", ")}

Blocks, in order: ${BLOCKS.design.map((b) => `\`${b}\``).join(" → ")}.
Optional: \`sizing\`, \`interface\`, \`levels\`, \`explain\` — a low-level-design kata may skip
the first two. \`levels\` is the interviewer rubric (Mid/Senior/Staff expectations);
\`explain\` is the three-level reading ladder (basic/advanced/expert) — they are different
blocks and both may exist.

The \`architecture\` block carries the primary mermaid diagram (a \`flowchart\` for a distributed
design, a \`classDiagram\` for a low-level one). A design links to the patterns it uses through the
typed \`relationships\` block — \`node ../../scripts/kb.mjs link <id> demonstrates <pattern>\` writes
both sides, giving each pattern a "Demonstrated by" backlink. Tag distributed katas
\`system-design\` and OOP katas \`low-level-design\`; designs carry \`data-kb-solves\` like a pattern.

Read with \`node ../../scripts/kb.mjs get <id>\`. See the root CLAUDE.md for the contract.
`;
}

function forPrinciples(list) {
  return `# site/principles

**Principles** — ${list.length} design maxims. Not a rung, not a lens, not a pattern: each is a
rule of thumb for writing good code at any elevation (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, and friends).

Pages here: ${list.map((n) => n.id).sort().join(", ")}

Blocks, in order: ${BLOCKS.principle.map((b) => `\`${b}\``).join(" → ")}.

A principle carries \`data-kb-solves\` (symptomatic search phrases) like a pattern, and links
into the typed relationship graph — most often it \`combines-with\` a pattern that embodies it,
or \`prevents-hazard\` an anti-pattern it guards against. The \`overreach\` block is mandatory:
every principle has a way of being taken too far, and saying so is what keeps the KB out of
dogma.
