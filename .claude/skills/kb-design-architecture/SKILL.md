description: Write or review the architecture and deepdives blocks ("How the system is built", "Deep dives") of a patterns-kb design page — one narrative in two blocks: a lead and L1 board with a components-and-communication walk and an FR-coverage trace, then one NFR-driven deep dive per non-functional requirement, each carrying its own L2 zoom or an iterated evolution of the board. Use when someone asks to "write the architecture block", "draw how the system is built", "add the deep dives", "trace the requirements to components", "label the components with patterns", or says a requirement is satisfied nowhere visible or the deep dives read as trivia instead of arguments. Also use to review, evaluate, critique, audit or grade an existing architecture or deepdives block, including when the ask names it by file path or URL fragment (`…/<page>.html#architecture`, `#deepdives`).

# Writing the architecture and deepdives blocks

**The architecture block proves the system satisfies every functional requirement; the
deep dives prove it satisfies every non-functional one — two blocks, one coverage
contract, and nothing on the board that neither proof needs.** This is the whiteboard
slice of the interview: the L1 board is drawn breadth-first so the whole system is
visible at once, and each deep dive zooms or iterates on demand, one NFR at a time.

```

Heading texts are exactly **"How the system is built"** and **"Deep dives"** (a suffix
naming the page's angle is allowed). Every `<figure class="diagram">` is a **sibling of
the `.prose` div, a direct child of the section — never nested inside prose**: that keeps
each dive a self-contained prose+figure pair that can be moved or reviewed as a unit,
and matches the canonical wrapper in diagram-draw's site-embedding reference. Both
blocks are hand-edited HTML — no `kb.mjs` writer exists for them; the PostToolUse hook
checks structure, not content.

## The architecture shape

Lead, board, walk, trace — in that order.

### 1. Lead — entry point and the flow at a glance

One `<p>`: where a request enters, the one structural decision that shapes everything
(a read/write split, an event-driven core, a single orchestrator), and the main flows in
a sentence each. The reader gets the whole answer here; the board is the proof.

### 2. The L1 board

One primary diagram: `flowchart TB` for a `system-design` page, `classDiagram` for a
`low-level-design` kata. How to draw it — node cap, edge labels, `:::ext` dashing — is
diagram-draw's contract (see below). What this skill adds is naming discipline: **every
node label must be a name the entities, interface or sizing blocks already use**, and
every node must reappear as a row in the components walk. A box that gets no row
is scope creep; a name the rest of the page never uses is a second vocabulary.

### 3. Components & communication

`<h3 id="architecture-h-components">Components &amp; communication</h3>` then a
`table.decision` in a `.table-scroll`, **one row per board node**: `Component` names it,
`Role, and what it talks to` gives its role in one clause plus who it talks to and with
what payload. The first row names where requests enter.

**A table, not a list, because the roster is a lookup.** A reader arriving from the board
wants one node's row; a bullet list of ten `<strong>Name</strong> — 40-word clause` items
makes them scan every entry to find it. The rows carry the cross-block contract unchanged:
a store row names the entity it holds, a service row names the endpoints it serves, and the
payload wording reuses the interface block's verbs and status codes.

The table is a **sibling** of the `.prose` div, like a figure — close the prose after the
heading, emit the table, reopen prose for the trace.

**Past about eight rows the flat table stops working, and the answer is modules.** A roster
is a lookup only while the reader already knows which component they want. At ten rows of
50-word cells it is a wall: nothing on it says which components work together as a unit, so
the reader holds ten unrelated names in their head and reassembles the system themselves.
Split the components into **modules by purpose** — each one a small design you could build
on its own — and the block becomes summary, assembly board, then one fold per module:

```html
<div class="prose">
  <h3 id="architecture-h-components">Components &amp; communication<span class="subline">seven modules, each one a design you could build on its own</span></h3>
  <p>Each module named in one clause, then the sentence saying how they assemble.</p>
</div>
<figure class="diagram">…the assembly board: one node per module…</figure>
<details class="module-wrap" id="architecture-modules">
  <summary>the seven modules, one at a time</summary>
  <details class="module-group" id="architecture-mod-ingress">
    <summary><h4 id="architecture-h-mod-ingress">1 · Ingress — one door, one commit<span class="subline">the API, the inbox, the log and the work it queues</span></h4></summary>
    <div class="prose">
      <p><strong>What it is for.</strong> … and what breaks without it.</p>
      <p><strong>How it works.</strong> … in the board's own order.</p>
    </div>
    <figure class="diagram">…this module's L2 board…</figure>
    <div class="table-scroll"><table class="decision">…this module's 2–4 rows…</table></div>
  </details>
  <!-- one per module -->
</details>
```

Five rules make it a summary rather than a hiding place:

- **The contract does not change**: every board node still gets exactly one roster row, in
  exactly one module's table. A component two modules use is filed under the one that owns
  it and named in the other's prose. Nothing is dropped because it was awkward to place.
- **The assembly board stays open.** Summary paragraph and assembly board are visible; only
  the per-module detail folds. One node per module, edges labelled with what actually
  crosses between them, and the same ≤8-node cap as any other board.
- **Reuse is drawn, not asserted.** A module that consumes another draws it as a single node
  carrying that module's exact title — `Vendor leg — the reusable outbound call (module 2)`.
  Shared names are the only cross-reference mechanism the diagrams have.
- **The module boards keep the L1 names.** A module board is an L2 zoom, so its nodes are
  the names the L1 board, the entities block and the interface block already use.
- **Boundaries are subgraphs, and their titles are short.** The two worth drawing are the
  rows that commit together (`ONE TRANSACTION — all four rows, or none`) and the trust zone
  (`Private network — egress only`, `PII plane — separate credentials`). Draw both on the
  assembly board too, at module altitude — a boundary stated in a node's label while the
  neighbouring boundary gets a box reads as the lesser of the two, and the reader asks where
  it went. Nest them: the transaction is inside the perimeter, never beside it. Where a module has
  no transaction box, say in the caption that the absence is the claim — one row per commit,
  or no transaction possible across an HTTP call. Keep every cluster title under about 45
  characters and put the argument in the `<figcaption>`: mermaid lays two clusters of one
  rank side by side and their titles overlap into each other, which the build cannot see
  because the diagram still parses. One cluster gets the full width; two do not.
- **A trust boundary is only drawn if something visibly crosses it.** One `:::ext` node
  lumping "client · onboardee · vendors" makes the boundary decorative — the reader cannot
  see the callers arrive on one side and the third parties get called on the other. Give
  each audience its own dashed node outside the box, and draw the crossings as thick edges
  (`==>`, which renders at 3.5px against 1px) labelled for what they are: `EGRESS — the only
  calls that leave the private network`. Then the eye finds the perimeter before it reads a
  word.
- **Ids are hand-minted** (`architecture-mod-*`, `architecture-h-mod-*`): the build mints no
  heading id in `architecture` and reaches nothing inside a `<summary>`. Ship both levels
  **closed**; `sketch.js`'s floating Expand-all drives them, and the markup is styled by
  `details.module-wrap` / `details.module-group` in `pattern.css`.

Exemplar: `persona-identification`. Everything below — the trace, the dives, the wording
rules — is unchanged by the split.

### 4. Where each requirement lands

`<h3 id="architecture-h-trace">Where each requirement lands</h3>` then **exactly one
section per functional requirement, in the requirements block's order**: an `<h4>` carrying
the requirement paraphrase, its routing tag `→ FR: label` on the subline, and a `<p>` giving
the component path that satisfies it (Component → Component → Component). Hand-mint
`arch-fr-N`.

The section shape is the same one `sizing` uses for a capability, and for the same reason:
the requirement, where it lands and how it is served are three things, and a bullet welds
them into one sentence the reader has to take apart. A page whose trace is a table keeps
the table — it separates the same three parts into columns.

The contract: every FR gets a line, and every line names only components that exist on
the board. An FR that traces to nothing is a missing box; a box no FR or NFR ever claims
is a box to delete. The trace lives in prose, not on the diagram, because `kb.mjs get`
strips diagrams by default — the coverage proof must survive extraction.

## The deep-dive shape

Each `<h3>` in the deepdives block is one NFR argued to completion.

### One dive per NFR

Heading format: `<h3>N · Mechanism title<span class="subline">→ NFR: label</span></h3>` —
the numbered `N · Title` corpus idiom, with the routing tag on its own line beneath the
title. The label matches the bold NFR label in the requirements block verbatim (Scale,
Latency, Availability, …). The contract: **every NFR appears in exactly one dive
heading.** A dive may carry two tags (`;`-joined) only when the two NFRs are genuinely
satisfied by one mechanism. Order the dives in the requirements block's NFR order unless
a dependency argues otherwise.

**The tag goes inside the heading, in a span — never in a paragraph of its own.**
`build-pages.mjs` mints `deepdives-dive-N` from `.prose > h3`, so the heading must stay a
direct child of its `.prose`, and the tag has to stay inside the heading's text to survive
`kb.mjs get`. A dive that carries no NFR — a scenario walk — simply has no subline.

### Anatomy of one dive

Three moves, in order:

1. **Open with a bold thesis** — one sentence on why this mechanism satisfies this NFR,
   so a reader who stops there still has the answer.
2. **Argue the options** — the naïve one with the fact that kills it, the plausible rival
   with its cost, the chosen one with its residual weakness admitted. A dive with no
   rejected option is a lecture, not a decision.
3. **Give the dive its own diagram** — zoom or iterate by the rule below; a dive that
   reuses the L1 board unchanged shows nothing the board did not already show.

**A long dive breaks into labelled steps, and a label that runs for two or more paragraphs
becomes an `<h4>`.** Where a dive argues an enumerated sequence — four idempotency
boundaries, six rungs of a recovery ladder — each step gets a heading with a hand-minted
`deepdives-h-*` id, and the clause after its comma rides the subline (`Boundary one` over
`the client's create`). A bold run-in that opens a *single* paragraph is a thesis sentence
and stays inline: promoting it would put a heading over every paragraph and rank nothing.

### Zoom or iterate — the diagram decision

- **Zoom (L2)** when the NFR is answered inside one box — the component's internals are
  the mechanism. The zoomed diagram keeps the node's **exact L1 name**: shared names are
  the only link between levels. Prefer the zoom whenever the component's internal design
  is reusable knowledge — a range-allocating id minter or a failover pair teaches beyond
  this page.
- **Iterate the board** when the NFR forces a system-wide change — new boxes or edges
  appear, so redraw the L1 with the delta carrying the emphasis.
- The test: if you can name the single L1 node that answers the NFR, zoom into it; if
  the answer is "several" or "the shape changes", iterate. When the NFR is about one
  request's dynamics — latency, ordering, failure timing — an L3 `sequenceDiagram` is
  the zoom.

## Pattern labels — board and prose

Components are labeled with the patterns they implement, in three layers that never mix:

1. **On the board**: a node or subgraph that embodies a pattern carries the pattern's id
   as plain text after a middot inside the quoted label — `Cache[("Cache · cache-aside")]`
   — never a link (mermaid runs `securityLevel: "strict"`, and diagrams are stripped
   from extraction anyway).
2. **In prose**: the sentence arguing the mechanism carries the real
   `<a href="../patterns/…">` link. A rejected alternative is named without a link —
   `demonstrates` means *uses*.
3. **In the graph**: every prose-linked pattern gets a typed row via
   `node scripts/kb.mjs link <design> demonstrates <pattern>`; `kb.mjs refs <design>`
   flags any prose link with no typed relation.

Verify a pattern name before boarding it (`kb.mjs find`, `kb.mjs get <id> --block
usage`) — a wrongly named label is worse than no label. A pattern label with no FR or
NFR forcing that mechanism is decoration; drop it.

## Diagrams are diagram-draw's job

This skill owns *what each diagram is for and where it sits*; [diagram-draw](../diagram-draw/SKILL.md)
owns *how it is drawn* — the ~8-node/12-edge cap, verb+payload edge labels, `:::ext`
dashing with no fills, naming the requirement on the board, and the `<figure>` wrapper
in its `references/site-embedding.md`. Read it before drawing; do not restate it here.

## Wording rules

The lead, the components walk and every dive thesis are prose, and the same five rules
bind all of them:

- **Second person, active voice.** Address the reader as "you" and open directives with
  the verb — "Route the read through the cache", not "the read is routed through".
- **One concept per sentence.** A sentence that needs "and which also" is two sentences,
  and the second one is the one the reader will miss.
- **Every claim carries its consequence.** Say what the component does, then what that
  costs or buys, in the same sentence or the next: a box described without its effect is
  a box nobody can argue with.
- **No unpriced adjectives.** "Robust", "scalable", "highly available" assert nothing —
  replace each with the figure, the mechanism, or the NFR that forces it.
- **Emphasis is bold, never italic.** `<strong>` for a run-in label, `<code>` for a
  component or column name, and no `<em>`/`<i>` anywhere — the corpus carries none and no
  stylesheet renders italic. This holds for the pattern labels too, which are plain text
  next to the component name, exactly as the pattern-labels section says.

## Worked example

From `bitly` — the FR-coverage trace:

> ❌ *The store is a single relational instance with a read replica for failover.* — a
> replica box lands on the board, but no requirement ever claims it and no FR traces
> anywhere; the reader must trust that the boxes add up.

> ✅ *Visit a short URL and be redirected — `GET /{short_code}` enters at the edge; a
> miss falls through Read Service → Cache → URL store, and the answer is a 302.
> → FR: redirect.* — one line, one FR, a path of board names, and a status code
> the interface block can confirm.

The ❌ describes the system; the ✅ proves a requirement against it.

## Consistency with the rest of the page

Four contracts, checked side by side before shipping:

- **Names** — every board node appears in the entities, interface or sizing vocabulary;
  deepdive diagrams reuse the architecture board's labels exactly.
- **Sizing verdicts** — nothing sizing rejected may appear built on the board, and every
  capability sizing adopted has a box or an edge. When they disagree, the board is
  usually right and sizing missed a capability (see [kb-design-sizing](../kb-design-sizing/SKILL.md)).
- **Interface** — status codes, verbs and paths on diagrams match the interface block.
  Bitly shipped with a 302 argued in the interface and `301 redirect` drawn in the
  sequence diagram; the diagram is the copy nobody re-reads, so it drifts first.
- **Requirements** — dive tags and trace tags resolve to labels findable in the
  requirements block, verbatim.

## What this block is not

- **Not the sizing block.** Capabilities and numbers are decided there; here they become
  boxes and edges. No back-of-envelope arithmetic on the board.
- **Not a tech-stack listing.** A vendor name appears only where it *is* the mechanism
  (Redis's single-threaded atomic `INCR`), never as decoration.
- **Not a pattern catalogue.** Patterns earn their labels through the NFR that forces
  them; a board tiled with pattern names and no argument is the failure mode.

**Legacy note**: the corpus shape — one flowchart in architecture, prose dives, one
closing sequence diagram — stays valid until touched. This format is currently applied
to `bitly` and `persona-identification`. Migrate another page only when its design
blocks are being reworked on purpose.

## Self-check

1. Cover the prose: can the request flow be reconstructed from the L1 board alone?
   (diagram-draw's silence test.)
2. Walk the requirements block top to bottom: does every FR have a line under "Where
   each requirement lands", and every NFR a dive heading tag? This is the check that
   does the work.
3. Does every board node get a components row — in exactly one module's table where the
   block is split into modules — and does every row's name appear in entities, interface
   or sizing?
4. Does every dive open with a bold thesis, reject at least one option, and carry its
   own diagram — zoomed nodes keeping their exact L1 names?
5. Middot pattern labels on the board, real links in prose, and
   `node scripts/kb.mjs refs <id>` shows no new untyped links?
6. Do diagram status codes and verbs match the interface block?
7. `make all && make check`, then `node scripts/kb.mjs get <id> --block architecture`
   and `--block deepdives` (add `--diagrams` to review the boards) — the extraction
   should scan as: lead, walk, trace; then thesis, options, diagram per dive.
8. Is every dive's routing tag inside a `<span class="subline">` in its `<h3>` rather
   than trailing the title string — and does every `<h4>` step label two or more
   paragraphs rather than one?
