# patterns/distributed/resilience

**IV · Network → Resilience** — 9 patterns.
Keeping many services reliable, fast, and consistent across a network

Pages here: bulkhead, circuit-breaker, compensating-transaction, health-endpoint, load-leveling, rate-limiter, retry-backoff, timeout-deadline, token-bucket

Every page in this folder declares `data-kb-band="distributed"` and
`data-kb-group="distributed-resilience"`. The path is checked against them — `make check` fails if a
page is filed anywhere else, so moving a page means changing its band or group, not just
its location.

Read a page with `node ../../../../scripts/kb.mjs get <id>` — never open the .html to read it
(that costs ~3.6k tokens of markup for ~1.2k of prose).

Reading levels: the optional `explain` block ladders a page as basic → advanced → expert,
and `data-kb-level` marks the level an element appears from. Section-level values are
stamped from `BLOCK_LEVELS` in `scripts/lib/model.mjs` (generated — change the policy, not
the page); element-level values are authored via `kb.mjs level`.
