# patterns/gof/behavioral

**I · Objects & Classes → Behavioral** — 11 patterns.
Gang of Four, 1994 — the 23 patterns everything else stands on, plus a few essentials the book missed

Pages here: chain-of-responsibility, command, interpreter, iterator, mediator, memento, observer, state, strategy, template-method, visitor

Every page in this folder declares `data-kb-band="gof"` and
`data-kb-group="gof-behavioral"`. The path is checked against them — `make check` fails if a
page is filed anywhere else, so moving a page means changing its band or group, not just
its location.

Read a page with `node ../../../../scripts/kb.mjs get <id>` — never open the .html to read it
(that costs ~3.6k tokens of markup for ~1.2k of prose).

Reading levels: the optional `explain` block ladders a page as basic → advanced → expert,
and `data-kb-level` marks the level an element appears from. Section-level values are
stamped from `BLOCK_LEVELS` in `scripts/lib/model.mjs` (generated — change the policy, not
the page); element-level values are authored via `kb.mjs level`.
